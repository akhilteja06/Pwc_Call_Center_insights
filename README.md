Diversity and Inclusion Insights

The company is very keen on diversity and inclusion. However, they are not seeing any progress in achieving gender balance at a higher management level. In this section, I have prepared a dashboard about HR analytics in the context of hiring, promotion, turnover, and performance.

Here are the reasons why the process of achieving gender balance at a higher management level could be slow:

The number of promotions for male is higher than for females by 29.42%.
The number of females in the HR department is higher in senior and junior positions.
% of turnover for women at a young age is very less and most hiring occurs for young women. Hence if they have experienced women in the company they can promote them to senior-level positions to maintain the gender balance. It is the lack of experience women for higher management levels company is seeing slow growth in gender balance.
Companies also need to focus on job levels of operations and Sales marketing where the number of women leaving is higher. They need to ensure the environment is welcoming, comfortable, and safe for the women to thrive and that equal opportunities are presented to men and women without bias.
